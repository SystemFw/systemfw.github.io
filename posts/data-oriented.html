                <p>It is often said that “Learning <em>x</em> will make you a better
programmer”, for various values of <em>x</em>.<br />
In my experience the secret to making that true lies not so much in
the choice of a given <em>x</em>, but rather in the ability to apply ideas
from <em>x</em> to <em>y</em>, and then getting exposure to a wide range of
such ideas.</p>
<p>This post aims to show a fully worked example of this process: we will
look at a problem involving distributed transactions in a very high
level functional language, and solve it with a technique used to
rearchitect object oriented code in the presence of manual memory
management. Let’s dive in.</p>
<h2 id="intro-distributed-transactions-in-unison">Intro: distributed transactions in Unison</h2>
<p>My day job involves designing and implementing distributed systems for
<a href="unison.cloud">Unison Cloud</a>, the next-gen cloud platform we’re
building on top of the <a href="unison-lang.org">Unison</a> language.</p>
<p>A unique characteristic of our cloud is the power to manipulate
persistent and transactional storage as if it was an in-memory data
structure, via a set of <em>abilities</em> : Unison’s take on algebraic
effects that can express custom control flow abstractions as ordinary
straight-line code.</p>
<p>The model is fairly simple: you write programs in the <code>Transaction</code>
ability that operate on one or more typed key-value tables, and call
<code>transact</code> to delimit a transactional boundary, which will require the
<code>Storage</code> ability.</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>type Table k v = Table Text

ability Transaction where
  write.tx : Table k v -&gt; k -&gt; v -&gt;{Transaction} ()
  tryRead.tx : Table k v -&gt; k -&gt;{Transaction} Optional v
  delete.tx : Table k v -&gt; k -&gt;{Transaction} ()

-- like tryRead.tx, but fails on key not found
read.tx: Table k v -&gt; k -&gt;{Transaction, Exception} v

transact : Database -&gt; '{Transaction, Exception, Random} a -&gt;{Exception, Storage} a</code></pre>
<p>As a quick syntax primer, <code>a -&gt; b -&gt;{g} c</code> is a function from <code>a</code> and
<code>b</code> to <code>c</code> that performs effects defined by the <code>g</code> ability, <code>'{g} a</code>
is syntactic sugar for the type of the thunk <code>() -&gt;{g} a</code>, and lower
case letters in type signatures indicate generic type parameters.
Function calls are just whitespace (<code>f a b</code>), <code>do ...</code> is syntactic
sugar for thunks <code>_ -&gt; ...</code>, and <code>|&gt;</code> creates function pipelines.</p>
<p>Here’s the canonical bank transfer example, Bob sends 10 pounds
(represented as pennies) to Alice:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>type UserId = UserId Text

-- populated with data elsewhere
accounts: Table UserId Nat
accounts = Table &quot;accounts&quot;

transfer: Database -&gt;{Exception, Storage} ()
transfer db = 
  bob = UserId &quot;Bob&quot;
  alice = UserId &quot;Alice&quot;
  transact db do
    from = read.tx accounts bob
    to = read.tx accounts alice
    amount = 10 * 100
    if from &gt;= amount
    then 
      write.tx accounts bob (from - amount) 
      write.tx accounts alice (to + amount)
    else 
      Exception.raiseGeneric &quot;insufficient balance&quot; (bob, from)

-- no infra needed to run code on cloud!
Cloud.run do
  db = Database.default()
  -- `submit` accepts thunks with the Storage ability
  Cloud.submit Environment.default() do 
    transfer db</code></pre>
<p>The code snippet above runs <code>transfer</code> on Unison Cloud, where the data
is persisted on our distributed storage, and the implementation of
<code>transact</code> guarantees that the transaction executes atomically.</p>
<h3 id="data-structures">Data structures</h3>
<p>Transactions on typed key-value tables are a flexible building block,
and we can build data structures like we do for in-memory data.</p>
<p>Let’s build a <code>Counter</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>type Counter = Counter (Table () Nat)

Counter.named: Text -&gt; Counter
Counter.named name = Counter (Table name)</code></pre>
<p>The idea is that we can represent the state of the counter in a table
with a single key of the unit type <code>()</code> . Just like any other other
data structure, we can write functions that operate on our <code>Counter</code>,
using the <code>Transaction</code> ability to retain atomicity:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>Counter.getAndIncrement: Counter -&gt;{Transaction} Nat
Counter.getAndIncrement counter =
  (Counter state) = counter
  n = tryRead.tx state () |&gt; Optional.getOrElse 0
  write.tx state () (n + 1)
  n</code></pre>
<p>We can use our <code>Counter</code> to build an append-only log, similar to a
Kafka partition, by pairing a <code>Counter</code> with a <code>Table Nat a</code>. The
<code>Counter</code> will keep track of the current size of the log so we know
where to append next, and the table will host the elements, indexed by
their offset.</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>type Log a = Log Counter (Table Nat a)

Log.named: Text -&gt; Log a
Log.named name = Log (Counter.named (name ++ &quot;-size&quot;)) (Table name)</code></pre>
<p>Reading an element from the log is straightforward:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>Log.at : Nat -&gt; Log a -&gt;{Transaction} Optional a
Log.at n log =
  (Log _ elems) = log
  tryRead.tx elems n</code></pre>
<p>Appending to the log is slightly more involved but still pretty easy:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>Log.append: a -&gt; Log a -&gt;{Transaction} ()
Log.append v log =
  (Log size elems) = log
  n = getAndIncrement size
  write.tx elems n v</code></pre>
<p>note that <code>size</code> and <code>elems</code> cannot go out of sync since we’re still
in the <code>Transaction</code> ability.</p>
<p>A call to <code>Log.append</code> executes atomically when we call <code>transact</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>type Track = Track Text

playlist: Log 
playlist = Log.named &quot;my-playlist&quot;

transact myDb do
  playlist |&gt; append (Track &quot;Obstacles&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>and we can append multiple elements atomically as well:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>transact myDb do
  playlist |&gt; append (Track &quot;Sea above, sky below&quot;)
  playlist |&gt; append (Track &quot;Featherweight&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s conclude this section with a couple of notes on semantics that
will be useful later.</p>
<p>The first is that the <code>Table</code> constructor, and by extension
<code>Counter.named</code> and <code>Log.named</code>, don’t actually create anything in
storage there and then. A <code>Table</code> is just a logical handle, all the
action happens during <code>transact</code>, which takes the actual <code>Database</code> we
will modify. This is actually guaranteed by the types too:
<code>Counter.named</code> and <code>Log.named</code> don’t advertise any abilities, which
means that they have no side-effects.</p>
<p>The second is about the execution model of transactions, to help us
reason about performance. The implementation of <code>transact</code> uses
Optimistic Concurrency Control, which means that the first read of
each key goes to storage, whilst writes (and reads to keys that have
been written to) are buffered in memory. When the transaction completes,
<code>transact</code> will try to atomically commit all the writes to storage at
once. If there is a conflict, it retries the whole transaction, which
it can do because the Unison type system guarantees that the thunk
passed to <code>transact</code> doesn’t perform any other effects that wouldn’t
be safe to retry arbitrarily (like an HTTP call).</p>
<h2 id="case-study-stream-storage">Case study: stream storage</h2>
<p>We can now look at the problem this post will be centred around, which
is a simplified version of something I’ve encounted while developing
<a href="https://share.unison-lang.org/@systemfw/volturno/code/main/latest">volturno</a>,
a distributed stream processing framework (think Kafka + Flink).</p>
<p>Imagine we need to design the storage layer for keyed data streams.
For our toy version, we can go with something like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>type Key
type Event

streams: Table Key (Log Event)</code></pre>
<p>where we basically store a log of events for each key (the real code
uses sharding, but we will keep the simpler version above in this
post).</p>
<p>We want to implement a function to publish a batch of events to our
<code>streams</code> <code>Table</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>publish: Database -&gt; [(Key, Event)] -&gt;{Remote} ()</code></pre>
<p><code>Remote</code> is the ambient ability in Unison Cloud, it’s very powerful
but we won’t cover it here for space reasons, just know that we can
call <code>toRemote</code> to embed other cloud abilities in it, like <code>Storage</code>,
<code>Exception</code> or <code>Random</code>.</p>
<p>Ok, let’s plan the implementation out. We need to start by grouping
the batch of events by key, which we can do with:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>List.groupMap : (a -&gt; k) -&gt; (a -&gt; v) -&gt; [a] -&gt; Map k (List.Nonempty v)</code></pre>
<p>We then want to upload batches of events for different keys in parallel,
let’s use <code>Remote.parMap</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>Remote.parMap : (a -&gt;{Remote} t) -&gt; [a] -&gt;{Remote} [t]</code></pre>
<p>At this point we will be dealing with batches of events for a single
key that have to be appended sequentially, so we can have a
transaction that fetches the relevant <code>Log</code> and iterates through the
keyed batch to append the events.</p>
<p>Here’s the full code. Note the use of the <code>cases</code> keyword to pattern
match on the <code>(key, events)</code> tuple in a lambda:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>publish: Database -&gt; [(Key, Event)] -&gt;{Remote} ()
publish db messages = 
  messages
    |&gt; List.groupMap at1 at2
    |&gt; Map.toList
    |&gt; Remote.parMap cases (key, events) -&gt;
         toRemote do publishKey db key (toList events)
    |&gt; ignore
    
publishKey: Database -&gt; Key -&gt; [Event] -&gt;{Storage, Exception} ()
publishKey db key events =
  transact db do
    log = read.tx streams key
    events |&gt; foreach (event -&gt; log |&gt; append event)</code></pre>
<p>That looks pretty good, but unfortunately <code>publishKey</code> has a bug. We
fetch the relevant log with <code>read.tx streams key</code>, which will fail if
the log isn’t there, <em>but nothing guarantees the log will be there</em>.
The logs are per key, so we cannot create them all in advance as we
don’t know all the keys in advance. Instead, we will create each log
on demand if we cannot find it in storage when we want to write some
events to it. We will use <code>randomName: '{Random} Text</code> to generate a
name for our log:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>publishKey: Database -&gt; Key -&gt; [Event] -&gt;{Storage, Exception} ()
publishKey db key events =
  transact db do
    log = match tryRead.tx streams key with
      Some log -&gt; log
      None -&gt;
        log = Log.named randomName()
        write.tx streams key log
        log
    events |&gt; foreach (event -&gt; log |&gt; append event)</code></pre>
<h3 id="wrestling-with-optimisation">Wrestling with optimisation</h3>
<p>We’re dealing with a performance sensitive system, so we have to be
conscious about optimising our code properly. To start with, we’re
publishing all the events for a given key in a single transaction.
Transactions actually have a size limit, so this isn’t wise.
On the other hand, we don’t want to publish each event in its own transaction
and give up batching entirely, so we’ll compromise by sending events in
batches of 25, using <code>chunk: Nat -&gt; [a] -&gt; [[a]]</code> for help:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>publishKey: Database -&gt; Key -&gt; [Event] -&gt;{Storage, Exception} ()
publishKey db key events =
  events
    |&gt; chunk 25
    |&gt; foreach (chunk -&gt;
         transact db do
           log = match tryRead.tx streams key with
             Some log -&gt; log
             None -&gt;
               log = Log.named randomName()
               write.tx streams key log
               log
           chunk |&gt; foreach (event -&gt; log |&gt; append event)
       )</code></pre>
<p>Ok, but now note how <code>log</code> is read from storage multiple times
(one per chunk), even though we know that after the first chunk it
will certainly have been created (by us) if it didn’t exist.</p>
<p>Well, we can move the code that checks or creates the log to a separate
transaction at the start:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>publishKey: Database -&gt; Key -&gt; [Event] -&gt;{Storage, Exception} ()
publishKey db key events =
  log = transact db do
    match tryRead.tx streams key with
      Some log -&gt; log
      None -&gt;
        log = Log.named randomName()
        write.tx streams key log
        log
  events
    |&gt; chunk 25
    |&gt; foreach (chunk -&gt;
         transact db do
           chunk |&gt; foreach (event -&gt; log |&gt; append event)
       )</code></pre>
<p>Remember that the above is still correct: even if we get the <code>log</code> and
something else modifies it straight after, each call to <code>Log.append</code>
is checking the size of the log transactionally before appending.</p>
<p>This version of the code does avoid reading the log on each chunk,
but it’s still not optimal: if the log doesn’t exist and we do need to
create it, we will have this extra transaction just to create the log,
instead of creating it in the same transaction that also adds the
first chunk. In other words, we’re “wasting” one transactional
roundtrip that could carry some messages instead.</p>
<p>The optimal behaviour requires trickier code, we want to get (and
potentially create) the log on the first chunk, and then carry it
across the other chunks afterwards, using a fold:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>publishKey: Database -&gt; Key -&gt; [Event] -&gt;{Storage, Exception} ()
publishKey db key events =
  events
    |&gt; chunk 25
    |&gt; foldLeft_ None (log chunk -&gt;
         transact db do
           log' = match log with
             Some log -&gt; log
             None -&gt; match tryRead.tx streams key with
               Some log -&gt; log
               None -&gt;
                 log = Log.named randomName()
                 write.tx streams key log
                 log
           chunk |&gt; foreach (event -&gt; log' |&gt; append event)
           Some log'
       )
    |&gt; ignore</code></pre>
<p>Ok, this behaves as we want it to… but it’s starting to get pretty
gnarly. It’s not <em>terrible</em> in this short snippet, but the real code
dealt with additional concerns such as error handling, and this log
creation logic was really tipping the scale and making it hard to
understand.</p>
<p>Now, it’s reasonable at this point to want to introduce some more
named helpers to clean it up, but that’s not as great an idea as it
sounds in this type of system: named helpers might preserve (or even
clarify) the <em>intent</em> of the code, but they obscure the access
patterns to the data, which is important information for systems code
to convey. A couple of named helpers (<code>mapChunked</code>, <code>getLog</code>) can make
the very first version we had look quite harmless, for example:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>publishKey: Database -&gt; Key -&gt; [Event] -&gt;{Storage, Exception} ()
publishKey db key events =
  events |&gt; mapChunked (chunk -&gt;
    transact db do
      log = getLog key
      events |&gt; foreach (event -&gt; log |&gt; append event)
  )</code></pre>
<p>On top of that, there’s another instinct that’s even more pernicious:
a subtle bias to make the behaviour of the system worse in order to
have prettier code. Not every optimisation is worth its complexity, of
course, however pretty code is first and foremost a tool to achieve
the desired behaviour, not the other way around. This risk is
particularly prominent in a functional programming language, which is
typically geared towards elegant code.</p>
<p>So, is this the best we can do? Turns out it’s not, but to see how we
need to go looking for ideas in some unexpected places…</p>
<h2 id="oop-and-data-oriented-design">OOP and Data Oriented Design</h2>
<p>Unison is decidedly not an object oriented language: it has no
classes, no methods, no inheritance, not even interfaces. And yet, the
design we’ve seen embodies some of the ideas that have made OO
popular: it’s based on data types that mirror their logical domain,
keep their internals encapsulated, and expose their behaviour through
an explicit api.</p>
<p>In fact, here’s how our data model could be written in a
generic-looking OO language:</p>
<pre class="scala"><code>class Counter(state: Int) {
  def getAndIncrement(): Int {
    result = state
    state = state + 1
    return result
  }
}

class Log[A](counter: Counter, elems: Array[A]) {
  def at(n: Int): Int {
     return elems[n]
  }
   
  def append(a: A) {
    n = counter.getAndIncrement()
    elems[n] = a
  }
}

class Key(..)
class Event(..)

class Streams(streams: Map[Key, Log[Event]])</code></pre>
<p>There is a lot to like about this model: the behaviour of each
component is easily understood just via its public api, and richer
behaviour is achieved by combining these small components together.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the common FP criticism about the dangers of mutation
wouldn’t translate to our original code: transactions guarantee
serializability, which is very easy to reason about.</p>
<p>There is however another angle for critiquing this model, using the
perspective of Data Oriented Design. The ideas behind Data Oriented
Design come largely from videogame development, in a context where
optimising memory access matters a lot, and you’re managing memory
manually.</p>
<p>So let’s apply this lens to the code snippet above. We’re going to
assume a runtime representation similar to Java, Scala or Ruby, except
without a GC.</p>
<p>The main thing to note is how many pointers are involved at runtime
here: <code>Streams</code> has a pointer to a <code>Map</code>, which has pointers to
various instances of <code>Log</code>, which have pointers to instances of
<code>Counter</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>This is problematic for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>From a performance point of view, accessing a piece of data involves
several roundtrips to memory as we hop from pointer to pointer.
Also, creating data requires a bunch of tiny individual heap
allocations.</li>
<li>From a simplicity point of view, manual memory management is error
prone as each pointer has to have its memory deallocated
individually, and in a specific order. E.g. freeing our <code>Streams</code>
class involves iterating over the <code>Map</code> to free each <code>Log</code>, and
freeing each <code>Log</code> involves freeing the <code>Counter</code> and iterating over
the <code>Array</code> to free each <code>A</code>, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data Oriented Design on the other hand would forego nested pointers in
favour of structuring data as flat arrays indexed by integer IDs. We
could then access it efficiently by reading whole chunks of memory,
and allocate it and deallocate it in bulk, without worrying about the
lifetimes of its individual pieces.</p>
<p>But beyond specific technical strategies, Data Oriented Design
advocates for a very different way to approach data modelling: we
should not strive for code to reflect the logical domain we’re working
in, but rather frame programs as data transformations, and then
identity the simplest, most efficient way for the <em>machine</em> to perform
the desired transformation.</p>
<p>Now, it’s easy to dismiss all this as supremely irrelevant to us: we
<em>do</em> have a GC, we enjoy it very much thank you, and we’re in a far
higher level language anyway where this minutiae ought not to matter.</p>
<p>But let’s zoom out a bit: it is true that in a higher level language
there’s less emphasis about counting every single memory access,
however in our transactional code the pointer hopping mapped to reads
from storage, and we <em>did</em> care about minimising those. We also didn’t
have to deal with manual deallocation of memory, but the chief
complication in <code>publishKey</code> could indeed be framed as a problem with
<em>lifetimes</em>, specifically about having to create these <code>Log</code> instances
at the right time.</p>
<p>So let’s try to apply Data Oriented Design to our problem and see if
it bears any fruit.</p>
<h3 id="data-oriented-design-in-action">Data Oriented Design in action</h3>
<p>Let’s look back at the most optimised version of our code:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>publishKey: Database -&gt; Key -&gt; [Event] -&gt;{Storage, Exception} ()
publishKey db key events =
  events
    |&gt; chunk 25
    |&gt; foldLeft_ None (log chunk -&gt;
         transact db do
           log' = match log with
             Some log -&gt; log
             None -&gt; match tryRead.tx streams key with
               Some log -&gt; log
               None -&gt;
                 log = Log.named randomName()
                 write.tx streams key log
                 log
           chunk |&gt; foreach (event -&gt; log' |&gt; append event)
           Some log'
       )
    |&gt; ignore</code></pre>
<p>Remember that the complexity in this code is to ensure that each call
to <code>publishKey</code> fetches the log once, if it exists, and creates it in
the same roundtrip that carries the first chunk of events, if it
doesn’t.</p>
<p>Also note that <code>append</code> involves another read from storage to fetch
the latest size of the log: that call <em>has</em> to happen once per chunk,
so that we don’t overwrite any events if a concurrent call to
<code>publishKey</code> has published some events in between two of our chunks.
It might seem like this storage read happens once <em>per message</em> rather
than once per chunk, but subsequent calls to <code>append</code> in a single
transaction will read the log size from memory since previous appends
have buffered a write to it (this ensures that transactions see a
consistent snapshot).</p>
<p>Ok, now let’s apply Data Oriented Design instead, we will forget about
our existing abstractions in favour of looking at the essential data
transformations that define our problem.</p>
<p>What data do we need to read a message in a keyed stream? Such a message
would be identified by its key, and by its index in the stream, so we
have a mapping:</p>
<pre><code>(Key, Nat) ---&gt; Event</code></pre>
<p>That’s not enough information to write new events though, we also have
to keep track of the size of each stream, to know which index to write
at next. There is one stream per key, so we need a mapping:</p>
<pre><code>Key ---&gt; Nat</code></pre>
<p>We can easily represent these mappings as <code>Table</code>s:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>streams: Table (Key, Nat) Event
streamSizes: Table Key Nat</code></pre>
<p>writing a chunk of events is now straightforward: in a single
transaction we read the size of the stream for a given key, compute
the range of indexes the new events will have, and write the new size
to the <code>streamSizes</code> table, and the events to the <code>streams</code> table. We
do that for every chunk in our input batch.</p>
<p>Here’s the new and improved code:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>streams: Table (Key, Nat) Event
streams = Table &quot;streams&quot;

streamSizes: Table Key Nat
streamSizes = Table &quot;stream-sizes&quot;

publishKey: Database -&gt; Key -&gt; [Event] -&gt;{Storage, Exception} ()
publishKey db key events =
  events
    |&gt; chunk 25
    |&gt; foreach (chunk -&gt;
         transact db do
           start = tryRead.tx streamSizes key |&gt; Optional.getOrElse 0
           write.tx streamSizes key (start + size chunk)
           chunk
             |&gt; indexed
             |&gt; foreach cases (event, n) -&gt; write.tx streams (key, start + n) event
       )</code></pre>
<p>That’s a lot less convoluted!</p>
<p>But not just that, it’s also <em>more</em> performant than the most optimised
version we had previously: both versions read the log size on each
chunk, but the previous version would also have to read and
potentially write the <code>Log</code> object itself on the first chunk of each
call, that’s just
gone here. And note how much easier it is to reason about the access
patterns to storage in the first place, previously we’d have to look
at <code>publishKey</code>, <code>Log.append</code> and <code>Counter.getAndIncrement</code>, whereas
now we just have to look at <code>publishKey</code>.</p>
<p>But hold on, you might say, how can the log management just disappear,
have we lost anything in the transition to this new design? Well, in
retrospect we can see how the previous design was more powerful than we
actually need, this representation:</p>
<pre><code>streams: Table Key (Log Event)</code></pre>
<p>can also represent dynamic logs, for example a log that expires every
15 minutes and gets replaced by a new one.</p>
<p>We don’t need this power here, but are forced to pay for it
regardless, both in the complexity of dealing with log creation, and
with the performance hit of having each call to <code>publishKey</code> read the
<code>Log</code> object, even though its identity will never change, only its
contents will.</p>
<p>Focusing on essential data transformations helped us hone in on
exactly what we need, and delivered code that is <em>both</em> simpler and
faster in this scenario.</p>
<p>It’s also interesting how Data Oriented Design changed our code in
much the same way it does when applied to an in-memory OO codebase: we
no longer have these self-contained objects like <code>Log</code> and <code>Counter</code>,
connected by nested pointers (dynamic table names), with pointer
hopping (<code>streams</code> –&gt; <code>Log</code> –&gt; <code>Counter</code>). Instead, data is layed
out in flat tables with static indexes.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You shouldn’t walk away from this post thinking that there is a
universal winner between the two approaches we discussed today.
Instead, you should look critically at the tradeoffs.</p>
<p>The OO design is more composable, it gives us nice building blocks
that we can package in a library and reuse in interesting ways to
easily assemble novel behaviour. Conversely, if we’re willing to give
up flexibility, Data Oriented Design can result in simpler code,
and with an easier path to optimal performance.</p>
<p>There is something deeper here, regarding the nature of abstraction
itself: abstraction generalises solutions to similar problems by
<em>forgetting about their differences</em>.</p>
<p>For example, we can generalise several scenarios where data needs to
be linearised into the concept of a <code>Log</code>, which leaves space in our
brain to think about other parts of the problem and therefore raises
the ceiling of what we’re able to accomplish. However, the most
<em>optimal</em> solution for a given subproblem relies almost by definition
on the aspects that make it unique in a class of similar problems, and
those are more easily discovered by tearing abstraction down. In our
case, foregoing the <code>Log</code> abstraction showed how we don’t have to
worry about log lifetimes at all.</p>
<p>I would argue that a greater appreciation of these tradeoffs is as big
a payoff from our journey than the code improvement that we got.</p>
<p>In fact, beyond any specific technique, it is the compounding of this
type of understanding that, in my experience, actually makes you a
better programmer.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A lot of interesting ideas are found in somewhat niche communities:
functional programming, game development, formal methods, futuristic HCI, etc.
Be curious.</p></li>
<li><p>At a first glance, many bad ideas make perfect sense, and many good
ideas sound like utter nonsense. Don’t take anything at face value,
but don’t close your mind too early either.</p></li>
<li><p>Unfortunately, cool ideas are often presented as universal truths
that ought to apply to every field of software engineering. Instead,
they are typically borne out of a specific context. Strive to really
understand it, and you will find ways to apply those ideas in
interesting, unexpected places that share just a tiny bit of that
context. Equally as importantly, you will know when you can safely
dismiss them as well.</p></li>
